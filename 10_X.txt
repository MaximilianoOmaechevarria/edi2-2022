El Astrónomo estaba diciendo, "Un entierro tranquilo es todo lo que podemos hacer. Hay 
punto en cualquier publicidad ahora", cuando escucharon los gritos.
No se había recuperado del todo cuando llegó a ellas, corriendo y
pasaron minutos antes de que su esposo pudiera sacarle el sentido.
Estaba diciendo, finalmente, "Te digo que están en el granero. No sé
lo que ellos son. No no--"

Obstruyó el rápido movimiento del industrial en esa dirección. Ella
dijo: "No te vayas. Manda una de las manos con una escopeta. Te digo
Nunca vi nada así. Pequeñas bestias horribles no puedo
describirlo. Pensar que Red los estaba tocando y tratando de alimentar
a ellos. Los estaba _sosteniendo_ y dándoles de comer carne".
La roja comenzó, "yo solo--"


Y Slim dijo: "No fue--"

The Industrialist said, quickly, "Now you boys have done enough harm
today. March! Into the house! And not a word; not one word! I'm not
interested in anything you have to say. After this is all over, I'll
hear you out and as for you, Red, I'll see that you're properly
punished."

He turned to his wife. "Now whatever the animals are, we'll have them
killed." He added quietly once the youngsters were out of hearing,
"Come, come. The children aren't hurt and, after all, they haven't done
anything really terrible. They've just found a new pet."

The Astronomer spoke with difficulty. "Pardon me, ma'am, but can you
describe these animals?"

She shook her head. She was quite beyond words.

"Can you just tell me if they--"

"I'm sorry," said the Industrialist, apologetically, "but I think I had
better take care of her. Will you excuse me?"

"A moment. Please. One moment. She said she had never seen such animals
before. Surely it is not usual to find animals that are completely
unique on an estate such as this."

"I'm sorry. Let's not discuss that now."

"Except that unique animals might have landed during the night."

The Industrialist stepped away from his wife. "What are you implying?"

"I think we had better go to the barn, sir!"

The Industrialist stared a moment, turned and suddenly and quite
uncharacteristically began running. The Astronomer followed and the
woman's wail rose unheeded behind them.
